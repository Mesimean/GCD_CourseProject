# How the script works
# 1. Merge the training and test sets to create one data set.
# Load data
# create data sets (x, y and subject)
# 2. Extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
# get columns with mean or std in names
# subset columns
# correct names
# 3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.
# update values with correct activity names
# correct column name
#4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
# correct column name
# bind all the data in a single data set
# 5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
# Writes table.
